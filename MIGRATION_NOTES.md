# React Migration Notes

## Overview
This project has been successfully migrated from vanilla JavaScript to React with TypeScript. The migration maintains all the original functionality while providing a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

## Key Changes

### 1. Project Structure
- **Before**: Multiple HTML files (`index.html`, `studio.html`, `explore.html`) with separate JavaScript modules
- **After**: Single-page React application with routing using React Router

### 2. Build System
- **Before**: Vite with vanilla JavaScript
- **After**: Vite with React plugin and TypeScript support

### 3. Component Architecture
- **LandingPage**: Migrated from `index.html` with all interactive features
- **StudioPage**: Migrated from `studio.html` with Three.js integration
- **ExplorePage**: Migrated from `explore.html` with API integration

### 4. State Management
- **Before**: Global variables and DOM manipulation
- **After**: React hooks for state management and lifecycle

### 5. Three.js Integration
- **Before**: Direct DOM manipulation and global scene management
- **After**: React hooks (`useThreeScene`, `usePlanetControls`, etc.) for clean separation of concerns

## New Features

### React Hooks
- `useThreeScene`: Manages Three.js scene, renderer, camera, and animation loop
- `usePlanetControls`: Handles planet-specific controls and properties
- `useMoonControls`: Manages moon controls and orbital mechanics
- `useControlSearch`: Provides search functionality for controls
- `useShareSystem`: Handles system sharing and loading
- `useOnboarding`: Manages tutorial and help system
- `useDebugPanel`: Provides debug information and controls
- `useMobileControls`: Handles mobile-specific interactions

### Routing
- `/`: Landing page with preview and recent systems
- `/studio`: Main planet creation interface
- `/explore`: Browse and preview shared systems

## Dependencies Added
- `react`: ^18.2.0
- `react-dom`: ^18.2.0
- `react-router-dom`: ^6.8.0
- `@types/react`: ^18.2.0
- `@types/react-dom`: ^18.2.0
- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: ^4.0.0
- `typescript`: ^5.0.0
- `@types/three`: ^0.162.0

## Preserved Functionality
- All Three.js scene rendering and animation
- Planet generation and customization controls
- Moon orbital mechanics and physics
- System sharing and loading via API
- Mobile-responsive design and controls
- Debug panel and performance monitoring
- Search functionality for controls
- Onboarding and help system

## Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- The original `main.js` file has been refactored into React hooks
- All CSS styles have been preserved
- API integration remains unchanged
- Three.js integration is now properly managed through React lifecycle
- TypeScript provides better type safety and development experience

## Future Improvements
- Implement proper planet generation logic in React hooks
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Implement code splitting for better performance
- Add unit tests for React components
- Consider using a state management library for complex state
